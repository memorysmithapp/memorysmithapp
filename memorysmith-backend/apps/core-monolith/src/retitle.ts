/**
 * Entrypoint of the retitling migration (#102), run against the version IN
 * PRODUCTION, before 0.6.0 goes up.
 *
 * Every note already written carries its title as an ATTRIBUTE of the note and
 * nothing in its content, and every link in it was written to be found by a
 * slug that folded case, accents and punctuation. The moment 0.6.0 is
 * deployed, both facts turn into the same failure: notes with no addressable
 * title, every wikilink pending, and a graph with no edges — a notebook that looks
 * emptied to whoever keeps it, with nothing on screen saying why.
 *
 * And the deploy destroys the information the repair needs: the title has to
 * be written into the content FROM the stored title, and after the deploy
 * there is no stored title. So the order is fixed, and it is the whole point:
 *
 *   1. `deploy-aws/retitle-notebooks.ps1`, against the version in production
 *   2. the deploy of 0.6.0
 *   3. `deploy-aws/reproject-links.ps1`
 *
 * A third entrypoint on the same bundle, next to `recount.ts`, and for the
 * same reason: it is triggered by an operator rather than by a request or a
 * stream. It reports before it writes and writes only with `--apply`, because
 * a job that silently rewrites content nobody looked at is how a wrong
 * migration becomes the new notebook.
 *
 * WHY IT GOES THROUGH THE API. Everything here is an HTTP call to the product,
 * signed in as a person: a job that wrote into DynamoDB or S3 by hand would
 * produce a notebook with no revisions, no domain events and no audit trail — the
 * three things that make a write of this product a write of this product. The
 * cost is one call per note, and it is the right cost. It is also why this one
 * is not a Scan like the recount: a migration of content is authored, and an
 * authored write needs an author (non-negotiable rule 7).
 *
 * WHAT IS PURE AND WHAT IS NOT. The three transformations — the retired slug
 * rule, the frontmatter insertion and the link retargeting — are exported and
 * tested; the driver below only reads, calls them, and writes back what they
 * returned.
