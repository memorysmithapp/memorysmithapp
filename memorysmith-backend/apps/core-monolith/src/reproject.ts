/**
 * Entrypoint of the link reprojection (#102), run AFTER 0.6.0 is deployed.
 *
 * The fourth entrypoint on this bundle, next to `recount.ts`, and for the same
 * reason they are separate: it is triggered by an operator rather than by a
 * request or a stream, and it needs no session at all. Run it with
 * `deploy-aws/reproject-links.ps1`, as the third step of:
 *
 *   1. `deploy-aws/retitle-notebooks.ps1`, against the version in production
 *   2. the deploy of 0.6.0
 *   3. this
 *
 * The projection in the table was built by the rule that just retired, so it is
 * rebuilt rather than repaired: an edge exists because the current rule says
 * so, and not because an old projection said so. What the rebuild does, and why
 * the check after it is "no edge is lost" rather than "the same edges", is in
 * `services/discovery/src/adapters/reprojection.ts`.
 *
 * It reports before it writes and writes only with `--apply`, because a job
 * that silently replaces a graph nobody looked at is how a wrong graph becomes
 * the new truth.
