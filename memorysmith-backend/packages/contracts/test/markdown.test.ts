/**
 * The two lists this repository keeps beside the profile, and the invariants
 * that keep them from becoming lies.
 *
 * Until specification v0.4.0 neither existed: the scope of the two hand-written
 * guards was read from `entry.ring`, and what the product deliberately does
 * not read was read from `entry.recognised`. Both fields are gone, both
 * decisions survived them, and both are now written here — which means both
 * can now drift from the profile in a way a field never could.
 *
 * That is what this file is for. A list transcribed from a specification is
 * exactly the failure `markdown.ts` exists to avoid, so the two that had to be
 * written by hand are pinned to the profile by assertion instead.
