/**
 * The two vaults that show the specification working.
 *
 * A conformance suite proves the notation is read; a skill teaches it. Neither
 * can be read by a person deciding whether to bring their knowledge here, and
 * neither shows the notation doing its work — a callout that is drawn, a
 * wikilink that resolves, an embed that expands, a facet that filters.
 * `deploy-aws/vaults/continuity-engineering` and `.../enologia` do, and they
 * are the only artefact of the specification that is documentation, demonstration
 * and fixture at once.
 *
 * **They are the first thing to age when a notation changes**, and they age
 * while teaching the wrong version to precisely the person who is learning.
 * That is what this test is for, and it asserts both directions:
 *
 * 1. every entry of the declared notation appears in **each** vault, so a
 *    notation cannot be added to the specification and demonstrated nowhere;
 * 2. neither vault demonstrates a notation the specification does **not**
 *    declare, so they cannot teach a reader something this product will not do.
 *
 * **The first direction is asked of everything the specification ADDS to what
 * a base parser already does, and that is a decision, not a filter.** Version
 * 0.3.0 restated CommonMark and GFM inside the document itself, so the declared
 * notation went from 31 entries to 54. Demanding all of them here would force a
 * setext heading, an indented code block and a link reference definition into
 * prose that has no use for any of them — which is the list of specimens these
 * vaults were written to not be. CommonMark is the floor every renderer
 * already stands on; what a reader cannot learn anywhere else is what this
 * specification adds on top of it, and that is what these vaults owe. GFM
 * stays in: a table, a struck word and a bare address are not universal, and
 * each of the three carries a crossing of its own — a wikilink inside a table
 * cell is an edge, a bare address never is.
 *
 * Which entries those are is `DELEGATED_TO_THE_BASE_PARSER` in `markdown.ts`.
 * It was a filter on `entry.ring` until version 0.4.0 removed the field, for
 * a reason of its own: an implementation is asked for the notation the
 * document lists and not for a specification in full. The decision above did
 * not change with it.
 *
 * **A third direction, added in the same cycle: the rejections.** They were
 * read off `recognised: false` and the specification stopped carrying them, because
 * a catalogue of the forms a specification declines can never be finished.
 * What this product does with `#subject` did not change (RN-DSC-033), so the
 * declaration moved to `DECLARED_SILENCE` and these vaults still owe it — a
 * vault written by somebody using the product contains only what worked, and
 * this is the one place a form that does nothing is shown beside one that
 * does.
 *
 * **A fourth direction, added with 0.6.0: every link lands.** Resolution used
 * to be forgiving — a target differing in case, in an accent or in a piece of
 * punctuation found its note anyway — and these vaults were written against
 * that. Each of those is a pending link now, and a demonstration vault
 * demonstrating a broken graph teaches the wrong thing to precisely the person
 * reading it to decide whether to bring their knowledge here. So every target
 * has to resolve, by title and then by alias, **except the ones declared
 * below**: a pending link is not a defect, it is a form these vaults are
 * required to show, and the only honest way to demand both is to name the ones
 * that are deliberate.
 *
 * The prose is written by hand, because a generated vault teaches nothing.
 * This is what keeps it honest.
