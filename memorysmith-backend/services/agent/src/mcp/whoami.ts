/**
 * The answer of the `whoami` tool.
 *
 * It exists because of the thesis of the product: a vault carries its own
 * instructions, and an agent that reads them writes like the person who owns
 * the vault would. That only pays off if the agent knows the instructions are
 * there, and nothing in the MCP protocol tells it. So the connector says it,
 * once, in the one call an agent makes when it does not know where it landed.
 *
 * The help is GENERATED FROM THE CATALOG, never written beside it. A prose
 * copy of the tool list would drift the first time a tool is renamed, and a
 * help that names a tool nobody implements is worse than no help: it sends the
 * agent down a path that fails. The names it walks come from READING_PATH,
 * which `catalogIsWellFormed` checks against the catalog itself.
