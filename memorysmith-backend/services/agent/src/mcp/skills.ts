const DESIGN_VAULT = `# Designing a vault from scratch

You are about to create a vault. This is the one moment where the vault cannot
tell you what it is, because you are the one deciding it. Everything written
here is what the product would have told you if it could.

## Start from samples, never from a questionnaire

Do not ask "what is this vault for?". An abstract question about purpose
produces a generic vault, and a generic vault produces vague folder
descriptions, which is what makes an agent guess where a note goes.

Ask instead:

> Show me three things you want to keep in here.

Real material, as it exists today: a norm, a meeting note, a paper, an incident
report, a contract clause. You usually already have them in the conversation or
in the work at hand. The shape of a vault is derived from the material that
will live in it.

From three samples you can already see what a folder is, what a note is, and
which fields repeat. From a paragraph about purpose you can see none of that.

## Then decide, in this order

1. **What this vault is, in one paragraph.** What belongs, and what
   deliberately does not. The second half is the one that saves work later: a
   vault that never says what it excludes accumulates everything.
2. **The kinds of note it recognises.** Two or three, no more, each with a name
   the owner would use out loud. If a kind cannot be told apart from another by
   its content, it is one kind.
3. **The folders.** One folder per kind of material, ordered so the reading
   order means something (order is signal, not decoration). Every folder needs
   a description that answers a single question: what goes in here, and what
   goes somewhere else instead.
4. **The template of each folder that receives notes.** It is the shape of the
   note, and it is the only thing that keeps the tenth note looking like the
   first.

## Writing the guidance

The guidance is the document the next agent reads before writing. Write it for
that reader, not for a human browsing a wiki.

- **Do not open with a title.** The Vault Context already emits a heading with
  the vault name above whatever you write, so a \`# My vault\` at the top shows
  up twice. Start with the paragraph that says what this vault is.
- **Name the vocabulary.** If the owner calls something a "finding" and not an
  "issue", write that down. The vocabulary of the vault becomes the query
  language of the search: any frontmatter attribute is a filter.
- **State the naming convention** for note titles, and give one example of a
  good title and one of a bad one.
- **Declare the frontmatter you expect**, field by field, with the accepted
  values. If you declare it, every folder that receives notes needs a template
  carrying it.
- **Say what NOT to do.** A guidance that only describes the happy shape gets
  followed halfway.

The server never validates a note against the guidance. Nothing you write here
is enforced: it is read, and followed, and that is exactly why it has to be
unambiguous.

## Before you say it is done

Check these four, in order. The first two are the mistakes that actually
happened when this was done without a method:

1. Does the guidance open with a heading that repeats the vault name? Remove it.
2. Does every folder that receives notes have a template? A guidance that
   declares mandatory frontmatter and a folder without a template is a
   contradiction the next agent will resolve by guessing.
3. Does every folder description answer where a note goes, or does it merely
   name the folder again? "Norms" is a name; "the reading record of each norm,
   tied to the text of that version" is a description.
4. Write ONE real note, from one of the three samples, following the template.
   If you cannot fill the template from real material, the template is wrong,
   and it is cheaper to find that out now than on the fortieth note.

## When to stop asking

When you can write the first note without asking anything else. That is the
test. Two or three questions usually get you there; a fourth is often you
avoiding the decision the owner already gave you.

const WRITE_NOTES = `# Writing a note this product can read

The body of a note is Markdown, and it is stored exactly as you send it. Almost
all of it is text the product never looks at, which is deliberate: what a
convention means belongs to the vault, not to the server.

There are exactly two places where the product DOES read your content, and this
is the whole list. Everything else you write is text, and nothing more.

## The notation

${notationTable()}

## What none of this changes

- **The server never validates a note.** It does not check your frontmatter
  against the guidance, does not check the shape against the template, and does
  not refuse a note for any of it. The Markdown you send is the Markdown that
  gets stored.
- **The frontmatter is not searched.** It is what facets are built from, and
  keeping it in the searchable text would make every note match its own
  metadata. Write in the body what you want found by searching.
- **No key is special.** \`maturity\` and \`reviewed\` are attributes like any
  other: the vocabulary belongs to the guidance of the vault you are writing in.
  Read it before inventing a field.

## What is NOT read, and is worth knowing before you rely on it

- A tag written in the body, like \`#procurement\`. Only the frontmatter becomes
  a facet.
- A block identifier, like \`^abc123\`. That is a convention of a desktop
  editor, not universal Markdown.
- A heading. Headings are searchable text and give a section name to a link
  anchor; they carry no other meaning.
- Anything the guidance of the vault invented and the server was never told
  about. Conventions are for the humans and agents reading the vault, and they
  work because everyone follows them, not because anything enforces them.

## Searching what you wrote

\`search_notes\` reads the body, not the frontmatter, and its query language is
the other half of this: \`"exact phrase"\`, \`-exclusion\`, \`OR\`, parentheses,
and the fields \`title:\`, \`folder:\`, \`section:\` and \`content:\`. Any other
prefix is read as a frontmatter attribute, which is what makes
\`maturity:evergreen\` a valid filter without a line of code about it. The
vocabulary of the vault becomes the query language of the vault.
