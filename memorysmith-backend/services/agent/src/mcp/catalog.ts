/**
 * THE TOOL CATALOG IS THE PUBLIC CONTRACT OF THE PRODUCT
 * (software-vision.md, section 9.1). The internal API exists to serve the UI;
 * it is this surface that external clients consume, and it is this surface the
 * versioning policy protects.
 *
 * Two rules shape every entry here, and they are not stylistic:
 *
 *  - RN-AGT-009: every tool declares a human-readable title and a read-only or
 *    destructive hint. Those hints are what decide whether a client runs the
 *    call outright or asks the user first, so a tool without them costs
 *    friction on every single invocation.
 *  - RN-AGT-010: reading and writing never share a tool. There is no generic
 *    tool parameterized by operation, and the catalog is built so that it
 *    stays that way as the surface grows.
