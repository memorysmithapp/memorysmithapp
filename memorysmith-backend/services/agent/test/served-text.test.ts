/**
 * No text the product serves to an agent cites a business rule code
 * (RN-AGT-021).
 *
 * The codes address a line of `docs/software-vision.md`, a document whoever
 * reads the MCP surface does not have. Inside a served answer `RN-AGT-020` is
 * a symbol that does not resolve: an agent drops it as noise, or reads it as
 * something addressable — a notebook, a folder, a rule to cite back — and spends
 * a step on it. The sentence around it always stated the whole fact anyway.
 *
 * The traceability is real and it stays where the other ~50 occurrences are:
 * in comments and docblocks, next to the implementation. This test only
 * separates the two audiences, and it exists because the boundary is easy to
 * cross by writing one honest-looking parenthesis.
