/**
 * VaultContextComposer builds the Vault Context: the guidance in full plus the
 * annotated tree, in one document (software-vision.md, section 9.2).
 *
 * It lives in the DOMAIN because the shape of this document IS the product,
 * not a presentation detail: it is the exact equivalent of what an agent gets
 * today by reading the guidance and running `ls -R` on a local folder,
 * in a single call.
 *
 * Four decisions are visible in the format:
 *  - the description of each folder comes along, because it is what steers
 *    where the agent writes, and that is why it is mandatory (RN-KNW-006);
 *  - the order is the DEFINED order, numbered, because it is signal (PP9);
 *  - the note count comes along, so the agent knows where the mass is before
 *    asking for any listing;
 *  - the IDENTIFIER of each folder comes along (RN-AGT-020), because it is the
 *    argument every folder tool takes and the only stable address a folder
 *    has. The numbering is derived from the current position among siblings,
 *    so reordering changes it and it can never serve as an address. Without
 *    the identifier here it is returned exactly once, by `create_folder`, and
 *    a session that created nothing can read this vault and not write in it;
 *  - and the RESERVED VOCABULARY comes along (RN-AGT-025), because an agent
 *    landing in a vault has no other way to tell an attribute name that means
 *    something everywhere from one that belongs to this vault alone.
 *
 * The vocabulary arrives as an argument and is never read here: the domain
 * knows no specification, and the list reaches this function from the
 * composition root, which is the one layer allowed to read the specification.
 *
 * The labels are en-US because the MCP surface is the public contract and the
 * canonical locale is en_US (CLAUDE.md, language policy). The vault content
 * itself is whatever language its authors write in.
