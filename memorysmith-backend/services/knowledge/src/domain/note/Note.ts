/**
 * Note: an Aggregate Root of its own, deliberately NOT part of Notebook.
 *
 * If it were inside, creating a note would have to load and lock the whole
 * tree, and the structural invariants do not depend on note content. "A folder
 * with notes cannot be removed without a policy" is eventual consistency (via
 * event), not a transactional invariant. It is the most important modelling
 * decision in the system, because it is what keeps note writing cheap and
 * concurrent (architecture-guide.md, section 6.2).
 *
 * Two details follow from it:
 *  - notebookId is NOT readonly: moving between notebooks is a first-class operation
 *    and the NoteId is preserved (RN-KNW-023), which is what keeps the audit
 *    timeline intact, since its key is by subject and not by notebook.
 *  - replaceBody takes an ALREADY written ContentRef: whoever talks to S3 is
 *    the use case, never the aggregate.
 *
 * The title is NOT a field a caller sets. It is read out of the body by the
 * chain of the specification, here, on every write, so a note cannot exist
 * whose title disagrees with its content (RN-KNW-035). It is `null` when the
 * content states none a link could name (RN-KNW-036), and there is no slug:
 * nothing in a notebook is a key, and two notes may be called the same thing
 * (RN-KNW-037).
