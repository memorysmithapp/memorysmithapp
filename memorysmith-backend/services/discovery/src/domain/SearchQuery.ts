/**
 * The search query language (software-vision.md, section 10.2).
 *
 * Pure domain: it parses text into a tree and evaluates that tree against a
 * candidate. It knows nothing about DynamoDB, about how a note is stored or
 * about where the content came from, which is what lets the whole language be
 * tested without infrastructure.
 *
 * The shape follows what people already know from a Markdown notebook:
 *
 *   lei 14133            every bare term must match (implicit AND)
 *   "lei 14.133"         a quoted phrase matches as one literal string
 *   -rascunho            a leading dash negates
 *   a OR b               either side
 *   (a OR b) c           parentheses group
 *   title:auditoria      match the note title only
 *   folder:normas        match the folder name only
 *   content:prazo        match the body only
 *   section:vigencia     match a heading of the note
 *   maturity:evergreen   match a FACET, whatever the notebook happens to call it
 *
 * The field list is deliberately NOT closed. `title`, `folder`, `content` and
 * `section` are the four the backend knows how to answer by itself; anything
 * else is looked up as a facet, so a notebook that writes `norma: federal` in its
 * frontmatter gets `norma:federal` as a filter without a line of code being
 * written for it (PP4, RN-DSC-020). The ubiquitous language of the notebook is
 * the query language.
 *
 * Matching is by SUBSTRING over a normalized form, not by token. That is what
 * makes a word invented inside one note findable by typing part of it, and it
 * is the behaviour a notebook user expects from every other tool they use.
