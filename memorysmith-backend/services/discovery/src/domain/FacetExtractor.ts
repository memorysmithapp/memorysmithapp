/**
 * FacetExtractor: the second sanctioned reader of content
 * (architecture-guide.md, section 11.3). It reads ONLY the frontmatter block
 * and classifies each key-value pair BY THE SHAPE OF THE VALUE.
 *
 * The block itself and the YAML subset of it are read by the kernel, which is
 * also where the chain that reads the title of a note reads them from: there
 * is exactly one function in this repository that finds the frontmatter of a
 * body, because two readers of the same bytes is the defect this cycle is
 * paying off.
 *
 * There is no list of keys in the code and no per-notebook configuration: the
 * vocabulary belongs to the guidance, and `maturity` and `reviewed`, the two
 * facets the product declares, are to this extractor attributes like any other
 * (RN-DSC-019, RN-DSC-020).
 *
 * Free text is discarded. An attribute that reveals itself as free text
 * through use is dropped by the cardinality ceiling (RN-DSC-024), which is why
 * `title` and `source` never become statistics without anyone maintaining an
 * exclusion list.
 *
 * The shape is the FORM THE AUTHOR WROTE, and never how many values that form
 * happens to hold: `tags: [contracts]` is a list of one item, and adding a
 * second value to an attribute must not change what the attribute is.
