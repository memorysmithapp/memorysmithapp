/**
 * What a target becomes, once there is a notebook to resolve it against.
 *
 * Resolution used to be a lookup: one slug, one note, one edge. Specification
 * 0.6.0 makes it a question with three answers and, for the first one, a
 * count — because two notes may carry one title (RN-KNW-037) and a link into
 * both is two edges, never the first one, since there is no order to appeal
 * to (RN-DSC-042).
 *
 * **Step 7 before step 8 is the whole of what keeps the frontmatter out of the
 * graph.** A title always wins; an alias resolves ONLY what no title matched
 * (RN-DSC-052). The objection that used to keep aliases out of resolution
 * entirely was that one could move an edge invisibly — editing a third note,
 * neither end of the link, to take a link away from the note it had landed on.
 * An alias that may only take what nothing holds cannot do that. What it can
 * do is create an edge where a pending link was, and lose it again the day
 * somebody writes the note that owns the title (RN-DSC-053).
 *
 * **And that is the price: resolution is no longer monotonic.** Writing a note
 * used to only ever create edges. Now it can destroy one, in a note nobody
 * touched, so whoever holds the projection has to re-resolve what it holds by
 * alias whenever a title appears, changes or goes.
