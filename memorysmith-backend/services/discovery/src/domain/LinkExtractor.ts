/**
 * LinkExtractor: the first of the two sanctioned readers of content
 * (architecture-guide.md, section 11.1). It reads ONLY the notation the
 * specification declares - no field name, no notebook convention - because what a
 * convention means belongs to the guidance, never to the backend (PP4).
 *
 * **A target is a title, and the two forms reach it differently.** A wikilink
 * target is LITERAL: nothing in it is decoded, no extension is removed and no
 * path segment is discarded, because a title is what the author typed
 * (RN-DSC-043). The three tolerances - discarding the path, dropping a
 * trailing `.md`, percent-decoding - belong to the Markdown form alone, and
 * their order is fixed by the specification: split at the first unencoded `#`,
 * then discard the path, then drop the extension, then decode.
 *
 * Decoding earlier would undo the escaping it exists for: `C%23%20basics`
 * would become `C# basics` and split at a `#` its author encoded precisely so
 * it would not be a delimiter, and `and%2For` would lose its first half to the
 * path rule. Delimiters first, decode after, compare last.
 *
 * What this reader does NOT do is resolve. It says what a note points at; what
 * a note answers to is the title chain and the aliases, and putting the two
 * together is `resolveTargets` (LinkResolver.ts).
