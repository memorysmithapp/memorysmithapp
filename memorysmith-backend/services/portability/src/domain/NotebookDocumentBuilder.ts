/**
 * A notebook as one document (software-vision.md §12, RN-PRT-009).
 *
 * **This is where file names used to come back into existence**, and they do
 * not any more. The export was a tree of `.md` files: the guidance became
 * `GUIDANCE.md`, the template `TEMPLATE.md`, the slug of a note a file name,
 * the order a numeric prefix, and the annotated tree a `STRUCTURE.md` that
 * nothing could read back. Every one of those was a **derivation**, and a
 * derivation on the way out is a second source of truth for what the notebook
 * says — which is exactly what this cycle exists to end.
 *
 * So the document stores what the notebook holds and nothing else: the note
 * bodies byte for byte, the positions as written, the identifiers as they are.
 * The name of a note is read from its body wherever it is needed (RN-PRT-010),
 * and the link destinations are never touched — which used to be a rewrite,
 * correct while a link addressed a file and corruption now that it addresses a
 * name (RN-PRT-004).
 *
 * Deleted notes do not enter the export (RN-PRT-006).
 */

/**
 * The shape is declared here and VALIDATED at the edge, against the schema the
 * contracts package publishes: `domain/` imports only the kernel, and a zod
 * schema is not the kernel. The composition root is what serialises a document
 * through that schema, so what reaches the archive is what the specification
 * of the format describes and nothing else (RN-PRT-011).
