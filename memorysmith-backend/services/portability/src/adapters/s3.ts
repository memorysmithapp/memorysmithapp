/**
 * S3ArchiveStore: where an export lands, and how the person who asked for it
 * reaches the bytes (architecture-guide.md, section 16).
 *
 * The archive lives under the SAME subscription prefix as everything else,
 * `s/{subscriptionId}/exports/`, so the first rule of the design holds here
 * too: every key of this system begins with the subscription.
 *
 * The bucket blocks public access, so the download is a pre-signed URL,
 * short-lived and issued for that one object. Nothing else about the export is
 * reachable, and a link that leaks stops working within the quarter of an hour
 * the use case declares.
 *
 * Every archive is written with the `lifecycle=export` tag. That tag is what
 * the bucket rule expires on: an export is a derived artefact, rebuildable
 * from the notebook at any moment, and keeping it forever would be paying storage
 * for a copy of something we already store.
