 *
 * **It answers from the shape of the last segment**, not from the structure.
 * A note is addressed by `<label>--<noteId>`, and the identifier is the only
 * part that is read (RN-DSC-055), so a stale label, a wrong folder trail or no
 * label at all still names the note. Asking the structure was what made a
 * remembered address break the moment a note was renamed.
 *
 * Two callers need exactly this question and they must not answer it apart.
 * `FolderRoute` asks it to decide what to render, and resuming a reading asks
 * it before navigating.
