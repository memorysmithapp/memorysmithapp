 * listing, a full match on folder slugs is a folder page, and a last segment
 * carrying an identifier is a note.
 *
 * **What decides is the shape of the last segment, not the structure.** A note
 * is addressed by `<label>--<noteId>`, and the identifier is the only part
 * that is read (RN-DSC-055): a stale label or a folder trail that is no longer
 * right still lands on the note, and the address is corrected in place rather
 * than answered with a not-found line.
