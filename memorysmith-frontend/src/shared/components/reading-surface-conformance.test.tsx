/**
 * The reading surface, run against the specification (RN-AGT-023).
 *
 * The specification declares a set of notations under the `reading-surface` reader,
 * and the two sanctioned extractors decide none of them: they are behaviour of
 * this interface and of nothing else. A rendering assertion cannot live in a
 * JSON file — what a callout looks like is not something the suite can state —
 * so the entries come from the profile and the expectation is written here,
 * once per entry, against the real components.
 *
 * **The entries asked for are those the profile ADDS to what a base parser
 * already does, and that is a decision, not a filter.** Specification v0.3.0
 * restated CommonMark and GFM inside `spec.json`, taking this reader from
 * 12 entries to 35. Writing an expectation for each would mean asserting that
 * emphasis renders as `<em>` — asserting that react-markdown works, which is a
 * claim about somebody else's library and not about this surface. What the
 * restated forms did bring is the **crossings**: the places where this profile
 * changes what CommonMark means. Those are proved, at the bottom of this file,
 * one case each and named.
 *
 * Which entries are exempt is `DELEGATED_TO_THE_BASE_PARSER` in the contracts.
 * It was a filter on `entry.ring` until specification v0.4.0 removed the field, and
 * the last case here is what keeps the move from costing anything: an entry in
 * neither list fails, exactly as an unclassified ring never could.
 *
 * The surface is exercised through `WritableContent`, which is what a note
 * actually renders: it splits the embeds, resolves the wikilinks and hands the
 * rest to `Markdown` with the callout and GFM plugins. Rendering it to static
 * markup runs no effects, which is exactly right for two of the five — the
 * mermaid block renders its container before the library is even imported,
 * and an embed renders its pending frame before the note is fetched. Both are
 * the assertion: the notation left the text and became an element.
 *
 * What this test guarantees is coverage as much as behaviour. A notation
 * declared under `reading-surface` with nothing here fails the last case, so
 * the profile cannot grow an entry this interface silently does not implement.

 * An image whose destination names a host is a request to that host, made when
 * the note is opened, by whoever opens it — and the trigger was written by
 * whoever wrote the note. A Reader MUST state whether that happens. Three
 * answers conform: never, only on the reader's action, or yes and we say so.
 * **Only silence does not**, because a person cannot decline what nobody told

 * This product gives the third answer (RN-DSC-040), so what is asserted here
 * is that the fetch is disclosed and that the disclosure appears exactly where
 * it is true.
