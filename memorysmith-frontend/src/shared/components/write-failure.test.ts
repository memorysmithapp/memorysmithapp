/**
 * A write that fails says WHY, and never invents a reason.

 * The screen used to render one sentence for every failure — "someone wrote

 * session and a real conflict all told the same story, and the story was
 * wrong for two of the three. It was reported from production as a conflict
 * on a note nobody else had touched, which is exactly the reader the invented
 * cause sends looking for a person who was never there (#75).
