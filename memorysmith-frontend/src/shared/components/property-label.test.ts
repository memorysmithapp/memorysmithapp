/**
 * The reserved vocabulary is written in en-US and may be READ in another
 * language (RN-DSC-030), and the properties of a note are drawn in a declared
 * order (RN-DSC-051).
 *
 * The translation stops at the label. The bytes of the note, what the export
 * writes, and what the search answers all keep the en-US key, which is what
 * makes a notebook kept in Portuguese answer `created:2026-09` and still read as
 * Portuguese on screen.
 *
 * The list is not written here either: it comes from the specification, so a
 * change that reserves one more name reserves it in this test too — and
 * the label guard below is what turns that into a failing build rather than a
 * key nobody translated.
