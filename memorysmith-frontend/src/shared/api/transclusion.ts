/**
 * Transclusion: `![[note]]` and `![[note#section]]`, expanded for reading.
 *
 * The expansion belongs to the reading surface, not to the backend. It is the
 * same class of work the wikilink resolution already does here: interpreting
 * universal syntax to display it, with the core never reading a byte of
 * content (PP4). Nothing changes in storage, in the write contract, in what
 * the tools return or in what the export writes.
 *
 * ONE LEVEL, AND ONLY ONE. An embed found inside transcluded content is drawn
 * as a link to its target, which is what keeps a pair of notes that embed each
 * other from hanging the page.
 *
 * **Three places an embed cannot expand, and one answer for all of them.**
 * Inside embedded content, past the ceiling this file sets, and — since
 * profile v0.4.0 named it — inside a table cell, because a cell holds inlines
 * and never blocks (§4.1). Wherever expansion cannot happen the embed becomes
 * a link and is never dropped, which is what `demoteEmbeds` does.
