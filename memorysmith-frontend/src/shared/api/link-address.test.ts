/**
 * The two addresses, side by side (RN-DSC-045, RN-DSC-046, RN-DSC-056).
 *
 * A **URL is an address**: the product writes it, a person copies it, and
 * pasting it back has to land on the note it was copied from. A **wikilink is
 * a name**: an author writes it inside the content, it names a title, and a
 * title may be carried by several notes. Putting the name in the address made
 * the address inherit the ambiguity of the name, and this is the seam that
 * undoes the merge.
