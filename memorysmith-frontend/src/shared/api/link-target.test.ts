/**
 * The target the reading surface reads out of a wikilink, held to the cases of
 * the specification the extractor runs.
 *
 * This file used to prove a slug, and the slug is gone. Specification 0.6.0
 * resolves a link against the **name** of a note: a wikilink target is
 * literal, nothing in it is decoded, no extension is removed and no path
 * segment is discarded (RN-DSC-043). So what has to agree with the backend is
 * no longer a computation — it is a reading, and this is where the reading
 * surface is held to the same cases the extractor runs.
 *
 * The boundary that made two implementations necessary has not moved: the
 * frontend takes what it needs from `@memorysmith/contracts` and nothing else
 * from the backend. What changed is that the rule they both implement got
 * simpler, and a simpler rule drifts less — the defect this file was written
 * for (#73) was a slug computed two different ways, and there is no slug now.
