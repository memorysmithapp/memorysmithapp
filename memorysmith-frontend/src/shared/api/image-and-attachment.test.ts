/**
 * The two halves of the image family the specification finished: the
 * dimensions an image carries in its alt text (§3.14, RN-DSC-048) and the
 * attachment a notebook keeps beside its notes (§5.8, RN-DSC-049).
 *
 * The crossing between them is the pipe, and it is read by WHAT THE TARGET IS:
 * a note takes the alias, an attachment takes the dimensions, and a target
 * that resolves to neither takes the alias — because reading it as a dimension
 * would discard text an author wrote. Whichever it is, the pipe never changes
 * the target.
