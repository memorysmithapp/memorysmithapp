/**
 * The revision a write echoes back is the VERSION, not the whole reference.
 *
 * This is the defect that reached production and the reason the frontend now
 * types the response by the published DTO instead of by a shape retyped here
 * (#75). The local shape said `revision: string`; the contract says it is a
 * `ContentRef`, an object of four fields. The whole object was therefore sent
 * as `baseRevision`, the API refused the request at validation, and no task
 * box in the product could ever be ticked.
 *
 * The assertion is made against the **published schemas** and not against a
 * description of them, because a description is the thing that was wrong.
