/**
 * A target that names a file rather than a note: an attachment, addressed by
 * its whole name, extension included (§5.8).
 *
 * **This product stores no attachment**, so the reference resolves to nothing.
 * That is not an error and the specification says exactly what it is: reported
 * the way a pending link is (RN-DSC-049). What it must not be is what it was —
 * a `![[diagram.png]]` fell through the wikilink path and was drawn as a link
 * to a note nobody will ever write, telling the reader the wrong thing about
 * their own notebook.
 *
 * The extension is what tells a file from a name, and a name may carry a
 * dot: this is the list of what a notebook actually keeps beside its notes, so
 * `Lei 14.133` is a note and `engelbart.jpg` is not.
