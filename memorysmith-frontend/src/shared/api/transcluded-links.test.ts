/**
 * A wikilink inside transcluded content is a link (#79).
 *
 * `Transclusion` rendered its content straight, while every other reading
 * surface resolved the wikilinks first, so a `[[link]]` inside an embedded
 * note reached the page with its brackets. The sharpest case is the one the
 * one-level rule creates itself: an embed found inside embedded content is
 * demoted to a wikilink — and §13.2 says that embed is drawn as **a link** to
 * its target. Raw text is not a link.
 *
 * This is the composition `Transclusion` performs, tested where a static
 * render can reach it: the fetch behind a transclusion never resolves in a
 * markup test, which is exactly why the conformance test covered the entry
 * and never the level underneath.
