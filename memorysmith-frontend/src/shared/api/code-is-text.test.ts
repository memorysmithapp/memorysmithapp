/**
 * Inside code, notation is characters.
 *
 * The reading surface reads the notation twice: once as a remark plugin, over
 * a tree where a code node is already a code node, and once as a rewrite of
 * the raw text, BEFORE the parser runs. The second one is `resolveWikilinks`
 * and the embed split, and it was rewriting inside code — so a note teaching
 * how to write a wikilink displayed `[Target](pending:Target)` where its
 * author had written `` `[[Target]]` ``, and the example taught the opposite
 * of what it said.
 *
 * The profile states it in the base ring: `code-span` is where an author
 * writes notation without invoking it, and a fenced block parses nothing
 * inside it. Both are asserted here, at the level where the rewrite happens,
 * because a rendering test only shows the first one that breaks.
