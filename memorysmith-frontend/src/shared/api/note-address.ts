 * **The identifier is the address; everything before it is decoration.** A URL
 * is an address: the product writes it, a person copies it, and pasting it
 * back has to land on the note it was copied from. A wikilink is a name, and a
 * name may be carried by several notes — that ambiguity is the model
 * (RN-KNW-037) and it has an address of its own, under `/links/`. Putting the
 * title in the last segment made the address inherit the ambiguity of the
 * name, which is the merge this design undoes (RN-DSC-045, RN-DSC-055).
 *
 * **The label is a slug and it must not be called `slugify`.** The defect this
 * cycle paid off was two copies of `slugify` that disagreed about what a note
 * was called. A decorative label cannot disagree with anything, because
 * **nothing reads it**: it is never compared, never stored and never sent to
 * the API. That distinction survives only if the name says it — called
 * `slugify`, it would be compared with the kernel's again within the year.
