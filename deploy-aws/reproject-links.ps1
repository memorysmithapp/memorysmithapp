.SYNOPSIS
  Rebuilds the link graph of every notebook, after 0.6.0 is deployed.

.DESCRIPTION
  The link projection is derived and rebuildable from zero (PE5), and the one
  in the table was built by the rule that 0.6.0 retired: a link used to resolve
  against a slug that folded case, accents and punctuation, and it now resolves
  against the name a note states, exactly, and against the aliases it declares.
  Every edge sitting in the table is an assertion the current rule never made.

  So it is not repaired, it is rebuilt: the edges are forgotten, what each notebook
  answers to is restated from the notes themselves, and the ordinary write path
  resolves every target again. An edge then exists because the current rule says
  so, and not because an old projection said so.

  It runs after a deploy that changed the rule a link is resolved by.

  THE CHECK AFTER A RUN IS NOT EQUALITY. A note carrying `aliases:` starts
  answering targets that no name matched (RN-DSC-052), which under the retired
  rule resolved to nothing at all. So the expectation is that NO EDGE IS LOST,
  and that every edge gained is one an alias or a name explains — both of which
  the report names, edge by edge. A lost edge means some note stopped stating the name its links were
  written against, and the script exits with 2 so a release runner notices.

  It reports first and writes only with -Apply.

.PARAMETER Apply
  Rebuilds the graphs. Without it the script only reports the difference.

.PARAMETER ProfileName
  AWS profile to use. Defaults to the standard credential chain.

.PARAMETER Region
  Target region. Defaults to the profile's region, then to us-east-1.

.EXAMPLE
  ./deploy-aws/reproject-links.ps1
  Reports what the current rule finds, and changes nothing.

.EXAMPLE
  ./deploy-aws/reproject-links.ps1 -Apply
  Rebuilds the link projection of every notebook.
