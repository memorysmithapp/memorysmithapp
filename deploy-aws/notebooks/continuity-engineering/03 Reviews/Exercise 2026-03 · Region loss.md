summary: A full region loss exercised against the payments path, with the timeline and the two findings it produced.
---

A planned loss of the primary region, run against
[[Failing over the payments database]] with the operators who had not written
it.

> [!tip] The exercise is the measurement
> Everything in [[Recovery Time Objective]] is a target until a page like this
> one carries a number.

## Timeline

| Moment | Minutes | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Detection | 0 | Alert fired on the health check |
| Decision | 7 | Waiting for a second signal |
| Promotion | 9 | The step in [[Failing over the payments database]] |
| Confirmed | 14 | A real payment cleared |

Fourteen minutes against an objective of thirty. The seven spent deciding are
the finding. ^timeline-2026-03

The objective was ~~forty-five minutes~~ thirty from January on, and the
struck number is what the drill before this one was measured against. The
alert that opens the timeline is written up at
https://status.example.org/payments, outside this notebook: a bare address is a
link on the page and never an edge in the graph.

## What went wrong

The freeze in step 1 was confirmed by looking at a graph, which is why it took
two minutes. It now has its own check.

$$A = \frac{43200 - 14}{43200}$$

which is $0.99968$ for the month, and inside the budget.

## What we tried to write and could not

- **A formula with a subscript.** `H~2~O` and `x^2^` are not notation here, so
  nothing happens to them: what is written stays on the page as those
  characters. The profile does not list a form for either, and anything it
  does not list may be drawn and never means anything. Write the real
  character, or a formula: $H_2O$ and $x^2$.
- **A styled warning in HTML.** `<div class="warn">` is stored and shown as
  text, never rendered. Use a callout, as this page does above.
- **A summary in the frontmatter.** The `summary` above is longer than forty
  characters, so it is read and discarded rather than becoming a category of
  one. The same is true of `title`, which is an ordinary attribute here and
  does not rename anything: this note is called what the notebook calls it.
