.SYNOPSIS
  Creates an account, gives it a subscription and fills its first notebook.

.DESCRIPTION
  A deploy seeds nothing: the user pool comes up empty and no subscription is
  written behind the rule that a person asks for one and a platform admin
  approves it (RN-SUB-001, RN-SUB-006). On a brand new environment that leaves
  nobody to sign in as, and nobody who could approve anything either.

  This script closes that loop end to end, and never by hand: it creates the
  account in Cognito, signs in as it, asks for the subscription with the type
  and the quota that were chosen, puts it in the status that was chosen, and
  then writes a whole notebook through the product API, from a notebook tree under
  deploy-aws/notebooks. Nothing is written into DynamoDB or S3
  directly, so the domain events and the audit trail are the ones the product
  would have produced.

  THE FIRST ACCOUNT OF AN EMPTY POOL BECOMES A PLATFORM ADMIN, and only the
  first: somebody has to be able to authorize the very first subscription. Once
  the group has a member, a later run asks for the credentials of an existing
  admin instead of quietly handing out the platform to whoever runs it.

  THE ACCOUNT IS HANDED OVER WITH A PROVISIONAL PASSWORD. Asking for the
  subscription and writing the notebook are done as the account, so the script
  needs to sign in as it, and it signs in with a password of its own that
  nobody ever sees. At the end it leaves the account waiting for its first
  password: Cognito e-mails an invitation with a temporary one, and the
  sign-in page asks for a password of their own the first time it is used.
  Whoever runs this never learns the password of somebody else's account.
  -SetPassword types a permanent password here instead, and sends no e-mail.

  The subscription claim is minted when the token is, so the browser only sees
  the subscription after a NEW sign-in: sign out and back in once this finishes.

.PARAMETER Email
  The account to create or reuse. Asked for when it is not given.

.PARAMETER Name
  Display name of the account. The e-mail is used when there is none.

.PARAMETER Type
  Subscription type. Only 'individual' exists in this phase (RN-SUB-018).

.PARAMETER Quota
  Storage quota: '500MB', '1GB' or '2GB'. Declared, not enforced (RN-SUB-019).

.PARAMETER Status
  The status the subscription ends in. Any of the six, including one the
  transition machine would refuse: the platform route that sets it is the
  administrative override, and this is what it exists for (RN-SUB-018).

.PARAMETER NotebookTemplate
  Slug of the notebook to write, or 'none' for an account with no notebook. Asked
  for when it is not given; the list is what exists under deploy-aws/notebooks.

.PARAMETER NotebookName
  Name of the created notebook. Defaults to the title of the source notebook.

.PARAMETER StructureOnly
  Writes the Guidance, the folders and the Templates, and no notes. Useful on a
  large notebook, where the notes are the slow part by far.

.PARAMETER MaxNotes
  Stops after this many notes. 0, the default, means every note of the notebook.

.PARAMETER PreviewNotebook
  Prints the notebook that WOULD be written, folder by folder, and stops. It
  creates nothing and calls neither the API nor Cognito, so it is how a notebook
  of six hundred notes is inspected before it is uploaded.

.PARAMETER SetPassword
  Sets a permanent password, typed here, instead of handing the account over
  with a provisional one. No invitation is sent. It exists for the first
  account of a new environment, which is the one that cannot afford to depend
  on an e-mail arriving, and for an account whose owner is whoever runs this.

.PARAMETER Region
  Target region. Defaults to CDK_DEFAULT_REGION, then to the region of the AWS
  profile, then to us-east-1.

.PARAMETER ProfileName
  AWS profile to use. Defaults to the standard credential chain.

.EXAMPLE
  ./deploy-aws/onboard.ps1 -Profile memorysmith
  Asks for everything it needs and creates the account, the subscription and
  the notebook.

.EXAMPLE
  ./deploy-aws/onboard.ps1 -NotebookTemplate engineering-knowledge -PreviewNotebook
  Prints what that notebook would become, and changes nothing.

.EXAMPLE
  ./deploy-aws/onboard.ps1 -Email ana@example.com -Quota 2GB -Status active -NotebookTemplate fermentacao
  A subscription of 2 GB, active, with a small notebook written into it. Ana gets
  an e-mail with a provisional password and chooses her own on the first
  sign-in; nobody else ever knows it.

.EXAMPLE
  ./deploy-aws/onboard.ps1 -Email me@example.com -SetPassword
  The account of whoever runs this, with a password typed here and no e-mail.
